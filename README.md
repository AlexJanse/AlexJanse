Hoi 👋, I'm Alex and welcome to my page! (^__^)  
👨‍💻 I'm a bioinformatician working at the Prinses Máxima Centrum in the Netherlands, where I play different roles with each their own tasks:

⚙️ Biobank Genomics Operator :
- Run NGS WGS analyses pipelines
- Perform quality control checks
- Share results with researchers within the PMC
- Assist researchers with questions about the shared results

🛠 Biobank Genomics Developer (as part of a scrum team):
- Improve and develop NGS analyses pipelines
- Improve back-end application like TreCode (Molgenis instance; database)

I’m also a developer and maintainer of pipelines to fill in instances of Glowing Bear and cBioPortal.

So far, I have programmed intensively with Python (OOP) and created all my pipeline using Workflow Definition Language (WDL) + Cromwell. 
I also have experience with Java, R and SQL.

This year I hope to learn more about cloud computing and building Docker containers.
